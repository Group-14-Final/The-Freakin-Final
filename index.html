                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">At Michigan State University, we as students strive to achieve academic excellence for everyone, regardless of demographic disparities. However, this has not always been the case for many people in different educational institutions around the U.S.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">If you were not aware of the history of Michigan State University, the university occupies the “ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Anishinaabeg, the Three Fires Confederacy of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi peoples,” (“Land Acknowledgement”). Our education was made possible due to treaties, acts, land grants, but also the many (forced) sacrifices made by the indigenous peoples who resided before us. The university, and specifically us as students, recognize that there is an indelible relationship with the creation of our land grant institution and the ongoing expropriation of Indigenous peoples and land, that is often overlooked. That is why, when accompanied with this opportunity from our professor, we have decided to act as spokespeople to raise awareness for the sacrifices indigenous peoples have made, particularly their sacrificed education.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">We’re obsessively passionate about spreading awareness about the multiple disparities in education, whether economic, technological, etc. and their impact on the marginalized population of indigenous peoples in our country. As a group of students, we have made it our mission to call for awareness for a change in the educational disparities in the American education system which resulted from the forced assimilation of indigenous peoples.</p>

                        <h2>Education System Reform for Minority Groups</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">In this day and age, there is still a problem with minority groups not receiving equal opportunities for those who are labeled “privileged.” These disparities are seen through politics, job opportunities, healthcare, the criminal justice system, and education. All these topics are extremely crucial in making a change to our society. In education, it is extremely important that everyone receives the same education and is not missing out on basic, fundamental learning topics. Not only that, not incorporating cultures of those minority groups is a huge issue when looking at trying to make education equal for everyone. It is unethical to ignore those basics of those with different cultures, religions, and ethnicities.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">The online article, “Emerging Issues in Indigenous Rights: Transformative Effects of the Recognition of Indigenous Peoples,” by Irène Bellier and Martinthere Préaud, provide a plethora of examples where indigenous people do not receive the same opportunities to learn some of the basic education that most people of the United States learn. At one point in the article, the authors state, “...education has historically been for states the privileged means to shape national communities” (Bellier and Préaud). Having one specific education that everyone must learn and follow blocks out the basics such as other languages, learning about specific histories, and learning about specific cultures. There should be a combination of education for all minorities and essentially anyone in school. This could be a pivotal change in education as minority groups can continue to learn about their culture while also learning what some see as the “basic education in the United States” and give the opportunity to those who are not in minority groups to learn about other cultures. Shaping national communities that have diversity is important and beneficial as it can create different solutions to problems, there can be incorporated information from different cultures. Being able to offer indigenous peoples education that those typically receive while also incorporating important aspects from their own ethnicity is a change that the education system needs to make. Another important quote that the authors wrote in the article is, “Achieving indigenous peoples' control over their education not only requires a transformation of their relationship to the state but also of educational institutions themselves” (Bellier and Préaud). With this being said, it is not only the relationship with the state that needs to be changed to have education changed, but also with the schools. If the schools are not willing to make changes to the education system with the criteria taught, then there will not be a change to make sure that everyone receives the same education while also incorporating aspects of different cultures, especially the culture of the indigenous peoples. Incorporating these changes will ultimately lead to a better education for most students, not just the indigenous peoples’ education, and can lead to new information being learned and a better understanding of the real world around those students. These changes would be crucial to each student in the United States and better the educational opportunities for students. Education opportunities for indigenous peoples and other minorities would significantly increase if there was a change to what students were taught to include every minority group possible.</p>

                        <h2>The Origin of the Boarding School</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Education to most, provides a benefit or a gain of knowledge, but for others it has meant something much more cynical. In the 1837 House of Commons Report, the British government deemed assimilation the only way forward for indigenous peoples residing in the colonies. In the United States, education became the main tool in assimilation. With the thought that indigenous peoples “would be better off…if he could be induced or forced, to adopt the white man’s habits, skills, knowledge, language, values, religion, attitudes, and customs,” (B. Berry, 1968, pp. 15-16). And it is formal education that has been regarded as the most effective course of action for bringing about assimilation. Perhaps the most seemingly obvious symbol of these assimilatory strategies and goals was the development of the boarding school system. These schools were usually church run boarding schools with the intent of forcing western culture onto the students. Attendance was mandatory and in these boarding schools, assimilationists forbid the use of native language through corporal punishment, suppressed native religions, physically and sexually assaulted students, and took them from their homes to work as laborers. Thousands of children died while in the boarding school system, so many in fact that it became common for the schools to have their own cemeteries. Those who did survive the school system, became deprived of their family and cultural identities. Yet assimilationists still deemed the boarding school system an assimilatory failure and soon began to argue that public school represents the best educational experience for indigenous youth. They believed that if they were integrated with other students with different ethnicities, that soon their own ethnic identity would diminish. To do so, the federal government closed most of the boarding schools, sending almost 85% of indigenous youth to public education. Naturally, with this change in education systems, scientists and researchers became interested in the academic success (or lack thereof) in indigenous students.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">But even extensive research in the field has made little difference in the academic achievement of indigenous youth. Most researchers, who lack full, long term commitment to the indigenous community, only feed into the assimilatory model. They do so even before their research begins. They ask the kind of questions that possess discriminatory language, such as “How do indigenous children compare with white students?” These types of research questions immediately put indigenous peoples in a deficit, supporting the assimilatory model again and again. This led researchers to even believe that the educational disparities derived from the native language barrier, indigenous parents being “apathetic and non supportive of schooling” (Berry 1968), and indigenous intelligence as inferior. When rather, it is the uncaring teachers and societal racism and discrimination that these disparities derive from. Therefore, it is necessary to have a prosocial change in the way teachers and institutions interact with their students and to move away from a “deficit perspective” to adopt a more universal learning system so that we can provide equal education to everyone, despite our differences.</p>

                        <h2>Historical Disadvantages in Education</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Educational disparities were present from the very beginning of the formation of the United States and exist even today. Of the different disadvantages that Indigenous Peoples have experienced throughout the history of the United States, none has had a more negative effect than the removal of indigenous children from their land and family and placing them in boarding schools. These boarding schools attempted to assimilate indigenous children into a “white, Christian” society. It caused indigenous children to be removed from their family and severed the connection between them and their culture. This had a detrimental impact on indigenous communities, causing them to be broken and it was difficult to recover. In these boarding schools, schooling was sub-par and many experienced abuse/neglect.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">The effects of this inhumane practice are still felt today as graduation rates of indigenous people are quite low compared to other ethnic groups, and education itself is still not centered on their experiences/culture/beliefs. The goal of this website is to bring awareness to the past issues that are still felt today as well as the ongoing disparities that they have caused so that we as a society can work together to promote change and equal education for all.</p>

                        <h2>Educational Barriers Faced by Native Students</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">It is clear that the state of education for Native students is troubling. These students have been struggling to achieve the educational prosperity they deserve. The statistics comparing indigenous students to their white counterparts are distressing. For example, “For every 100 American Indian/Alaska Native kindergartners, only seven will earn a bachelor's degree, compared to 34 of every 100 white kindergartners” (Davis and Tassin). Additionally, indigenous people are affected by low-income homes, lack of adequate health care, and other factors that all contribute to the gap in educational statistics. Furthermore, Native students “are 237 percent more likely to drop out of school and 207 percent more likely to be expelled than white students” (Davis and Tassin). Therefore, it is obvious that these students are experiencing a massive barrier when it comes to their educational opportunities.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Based on the research conducted, it is essential that actions are taken to close or minimize the barriers between Native students and their ability to receive equal educational opportunities. By closing these barriers, we will be able to not only preserve these Native cultures but also improve our society as a whole. Therefore, we will be able to increase our educational achievements as a society while also ensuring the barriers to education are nonexistent for all. If we work together to make these statistics know, I am confident that change will be made in order to minimize all educational barriers and improve educational opportunities for Native students.</p>

                        <h2>Contributing Factors to an Unstable Education</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Education disparities and disadvantages plague Indigenous communities for a number of reasons, for example, low attendance rates, low graduation rates, and high dropout rates. A few reasons for this are the feeling of not belonging and displacement caused by racism and cultural differences. Many schools fail to address the difference in the way Indigenous communities’ world perceptions and values. Due to these reasons, it can make readings, assignments and discussions more difficult.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">What we aim to do with this website is to spread awareness to people and institutions to help fix the racism and challenges Indigenous people face in education due to the misconceptions about their culture. A better environment for all races to learn can help close the gap in education between races and benefit us all.</p>

                        <h2>A Digital Divide becoming more apparent Druing the Recent Pandemic</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Particularly during the recent pandemic, the divide from a digital aspect has become a really significant issue. It was made clear that especially these indigenous peoples or low-income households struggle the most with their internet access. This being such a large issue for a large majority of these people, it has become a pressing issue. Once school went online, these students didn’t have the materials needed to continue to progress academically. This being such a pressing issue for these people it’s made clear that the same groups of people are who are suffering from this divide. The article I read stated, “…millions of people in the USA still have no home access to high-speed Internet. Low-income, people of color, older, Native Americans, and rural residents in particular are on the wrong side of the digital divide”. The cycle continues and the same groups continue to struggle because these students' parents were in the same situation when they were younger. They couldn't afford resources to help them find jobs, book appointments and they got stuck in this cycle that is now happening to their kids. They are all capable of success but not having those necessities and a strong education which they deserve, it makes it so challenging. This issue is emphasized in the article when it explained, “Internet access has become an avenue for finding employment, accessing health care, and pursuing formal education through online degree programs, to searching for information for more informal learning…Those who lack Internet access are deprived of knowledge that could assist them in obtaining jobs, lower consumer prices, online entertainment, and many other necessities..”.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 30px">Additionally, data from the Pew Research Center explains that, “...certain groups, unable to afford the cost of monthly subscriptions, continue to lag in the adoption of broadband including people with low incomes, older adults, those with less education, rural households, and those on tribal lands and US territories (Kruger and Gilroy 2019).” It’s important that everyone is acknowledged for their rights regardless of their situation. Everyone deserves the opportunity to have a strong education so they have opportunities to better themselves. This can be done by, “Recognizing that broadband is a key component in building healthy economies and educational systems and acknowledging that many rural and low-income communities go unserved or underserved in the digital age…”. Many of these individuals aren’t given the assistance they need in order to have the same opportunities as individuals as a part of a higher-income household. These issues have been especially emphasized during our recent pandemic and have shined light of changes that need to be made for these families so that this cycle can break.</p>
